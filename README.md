# Local Book Shoppe

## Getting Started

Use [this repo](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/backend-bookstore-sequelize) as a template. It is pretty barebones but is setup to allow you to use the sequelize CLI tool.

### Learning Objectives

- Use Sequelize ORM to setup a database and query tables

### Description

Use Sequelize to complete the same acceptance criteria as your previous deliverable.

### Acceptance Criteria

- User can get a list of Books
- User can get a list of Authors
- User can get a single Book
- User can get a single Author
- User can add a Book, and Author
- Jest tests exist for all the supported routes
- API is deployed to Heroku

### Rubric

+5 possible points for attempting this. I imagine that most people who work on this deliverable, don't really need the points. Consider this just a stretch for your learning purposes. You should only be working on this deliverable if you are completely up to date on all other assignments.
